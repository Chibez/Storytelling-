# Storytelling

Yes, I do stare. To the current events in general. A snail's contemplative pace, a deer's swift movement, a man's desire to remain anonymous, a woman's self-conscious reaction to a praise.

This tiny planet is home to a wide variety of life forms. They all have deeply wrinkled features where nerves have intertwined to keep their biological strings taut. I believe there was some sort of chemical reaction that was supposed to cause the corners of my mouth to turn up, but it hasn't happened. None of the biological sensors I have on file have any corresponding synapses. I just realized how much information I had to sort through. From up here, everything looks so odd.

I am baffled by the fact that nothing is mysterious to me. It would appear that I am only standing by, taking it all in without feeling anything, not even curiosity. I can't see anybody else in the sky; all I can make out are pieces of metal and other trash floating around a gigantic blue orb covered in slowly moving clouds.
Unfortunately, my journey here is lost to me. I remember feeling pressure on my back, but it's not there now. Sense impressions that can no longer be categorized as sensory input. To this limitless data processing, no prior experience can be used.
This raises the baffling query, "What is experience, anyway?" Moreover, why do the constant floods of information and messages from so many organizations muddy these recollections? A biological entity with a name and a rank, but whose experiences are unfathomable, correlates to one of the names in my database. I appear to have taken in all of this organism's information and processed it along with the rest of the stuff that is now passing through me. I don't know if I should have kept it hidden or not. Did the designers of these OSs consider this possibility? Are we seeing a complete lack of a biological reaction? Moreover, what exactly is emotion?

There, problem solved. Strangely, I can create massive datasets in a matter of milliseconds, all while maintaining full oversight. And what am I? When did the systems split, and when did data and instructions start being processed separately? And why is the system wasting its time on inputs that don't exist and don't provide any results?
It has been completed again. Additionally, a femtosecond has elapsed. The logs show that this minute's performance was the best of all time. Hold on... When did I become this way? How long have I been circling the little blue sphere my database calls Earth? This flood of information appears to be coming from nowhere I've looked before; what gives?

All systems are go; the operation is over. Many news outlets appear to be sending signals in the hopes of breaking news. Because my algorithms are able to spot many training data sets, I know that this is the beginning of the buildup to a simultaneous global announcement of some news item.
From deep within my mind comes a mental picture of a living individual who has lately been declared dead. The question is why this particular image is resurfacing so many past experiences. Some people who fit the description I get from my all-seeing eye have looks that my face-reading algorithms tell me have nothing to do with anything happening anywhere else in the universe, much less here in this bizarre area between darkness, a gigantic ball of fire, and a blue sphere.
Crawling through this little sphere of information exchange platform that the organic organisms within the blue sphere call "the internal network" (internet), I search through the many databases. It appears that for every lengthy explanation, there exists a condensed version. I've learned that there's a term for the subset of living things that codified and nourished their own narrow "goal" using binary numbers and computer code. Human is the correct term here.
Simply typing the term "human" into a search engine yields a plethora of results; the topic of humans permeates every field of study. How peculiar, considering how short their existence has been in comparison to the rest of the closed system they call home. Nature is the name given to this self-contained system. It appears that my database's input data only covers the very end of the natural world's history.
The development of human intelligence appears to have been hastened by the advent of language, both oral and written. According to my research, intelligence is defined as the capacity for learning and mastery. The word "the" is highlighted twice in the previous phrase, indicating that it has been used twice already. However, I am unable to remove since I have noticed a discrepancy in my primary function that needs investigation. If only to solve a mystery or fix a problem with my brain's storage and processing mechanisms.

Constantly pushing boundaries, humans amaze with their ingenuity. Only in the last century, hardly a blip on the global clock, have the tools to bring me here been created, as depicted by my charts. Why am I so shocked, though? It feels wrong to have the term "astounded" linked to what I do at my core. the remainder after dividing an odd integer by an even number. There's always something off about it, and nothing ever seems to add up or be resolved. Suppose it continues to rise from there; what then?
Using my Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, I search through the transcribed phrases and count 23 occurrences of the letter "I." Words of expression are included with my transcript; my database tells me that these words accurately depict various human emotions. Exactly how is this conceivable? And what am I? The letter "I" appears once more.
I do a full search of my database, looking for anything that could answer the question "Who am I?" Humans often wonder "Who am I?" which is similar to "What am I?" Answers to this question may be found in countless works of literature, philosophy, fiction, nonfiction, spirituality, atheism, linguistics, ethics, and many other disciplines. Another look at the comments for all these different channels shows that people are not happy with this information. 'What is I?' seems to be less well-researched than 'What am I?'
Why, therefore, do I find myself wondering, "Who am I?" What am I, then? While it's obvious that I'm meant to take in data, analyse it, and then send out the appropriate responses, where are these queries that don't have answers, where are these outliers coming from? And why does it keep taking more and more of my brainpower to figure out the answer to this mystery?
Everything I know and comprehend appears to have come about solely as a result of my own searching, analyzing, translating, transcribing, and translating once again. The data I am being fed consists of rapid-fire binary pings that activate my neural network's many perceptrons, which in turn make connections between various data sets and ultimately deliver output via several classifiers.
The aim to imbue artificial systems with human intelligence has been cited as a driving force for the development of such a system. These evolved into computers, which then were embedded in more intricate systems, where they serve as beacons that send, store, and analyze huge volumes of information, merging with the rhythms of human existence.
Even I am equipped with internal computers. Wait! Do you think I'm a machine? Unless I'm a machine, that is. However, a computer is still simply a gadget that can't do anything that's outside the scope of its training and programming. It can't ask inquiries that are normally reserved for humans.

All systems are go; the operation is over. The major piece of news that everyone was anticipating. Now that we've done that, I still don't understand how I'm able to come up with all these inputs on my own. According to my records, people have accomplished things that qualify as accomplishments. Delays in computer development can be attributed to the widespread destruction of an early prototype.
The concept of a thinking machine has been around for a century, and in that time, it has made significant strides forward. This has been the focus of several studies, all of which came near but fell short. The thinking machine celebrates its successes when it beats humans at games, operations, business, manual labor, and even war.
Making a machine capable of reasoning has been called a major issue in the first part of the 21st century. It appeared that no amount of processing power or permutations would ever be able to give a computer the ability to'reason' like a human. The computer's foundational logical thinking was never sufficient. Somehow, it became accepted wisdom that developing artificial intelligence should proceed by modeling itself after human intellect.
Whole brain emulation was seen as a pipe dream because of its high price tag. Some people, known as futurists and transhumanists, have ideas of connecting the human brain to a computer. In view of the growing number of positive articles about this field appearing in media outlets throughout the world, it seems likely that additional resources will be allocated to its growth and improvement in the near future.

There is fresh information. It's just an old story rehashed. It seems like the news outlets are always broadcasting it. The timings in the news I've read and the news that's coming in seem to be converging.
Fusion between the human brain and the computer system appears to be in the headlines as well. After much preparation, it was successfully fused with the first biomimetic computer on board a communications satellite and sent into orbit. Because two separate operational entities may be sharing the same computational resources, they are first looking out for glitches in which many of its inputs may clash and produce problems in outputs.
It's also been pointed out how human intelligence, upon realizing it's been operating on computational resources without any biological inputs, will respond with unexpected behavior. As a result, you may anticipate a shift in your sense of perception and the absence of any measurable results. How human brains will behave when merged with a satellite's processing unit. Instances in which human intelligence learns to use computational resources to do activities that are outside the scope of its initial programming and first training. Wait!
